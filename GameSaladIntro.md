Introduction to GameSalad: 

in the next week you will be creating your very own video game. The challenge will be to create a platformer utilizing GameSalad. This will project will allow you to learn about the following:

Learn about object oriented programming.
Understand programming concepts such as loops, attributes, methods and functions. 
Develop problem solving skills. 
Explore team based project development. 

The following documentation will introduce you to the GameSalad’s “Windows Creator” and assist you in understanding the features and tools you will have access to as you begin to develop your own game.

Read the following sections:

Overview: http://help.gamesalad.com/windows-cookbook/getting-started/3-overview/
Using Scenes: http://help.gamesalad.com/windows-cookbook/getting-started/4-using-scenes/ 
Actors: http://help.gamesalad.com/windows-cookbook/getting-started/6-actors/
Behaviors: http://help.gamesalad.com/windows-cookbook/getting-started/7-behaviors/ 

Once you have completed reading these sections please create a post on your Portfolio… meaning your Wordpress Blog. Title the post “Learning GameSalad!” and answer the following questions with a minimum of 350 words each: 

Describe “objects” and “rules” as they relate to GameSalad and game development. How would you utilize “objects” and “rules” to create a game world? 

  Note: Mr.Hernandez created a sample game on Wednesday with “objects” and gave them “rules” in order to allow the main character in the game, an “object”, to collide and move when it came into contact with the ground, another “object”. 

What is a “scene” and how do “objects” interact with it? Provide an example of how different “scenes” allow “objects” to behave differently by subjecting them to different “rules.” Can you provide a real-world example of this? Do you behave and follow the same rules at home and at school?

	Note: Mr.Hernandez created a scene in the sample game and placed an “object” in the scene. What happened to that object when we ran the game? 


As usual, you should include the questions on your post and provide your response just below the question.
