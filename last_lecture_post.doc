Self Expression

Randy Pausch describes his cancer as “an engineering problem.” How was this a helpful
way to look at his illness? He talks about the lecture as a means of expression, and a
way to reach his kids: “If I were a painter, I would have painted for them. If I were a
musician, I would have composed music. But I am a lecturer. So I lectured.” There are so
many ways to communicate. What are your own avenues for self­expression?

The Elephant in the Room

Randy decided to begin his talk in a specific way – showing his CT scans, introducing
“the elephant in the room,” assuring everyone he’s not in denial, and doing push­ups.
What made this effective? What were you thinking watching this for the first time via
video?

The Parent Lottery

Randy said he realized many of his dreams because he had terrific parents. What details
from his childhood do you think led to the successes he had later in life? Are there
lessons in Randy’s story for people who’ve had less­fulfilling childhoods, or absentee
parents? What advice might you give to those who didn’t win “the parent lottery”?

The Elevator in the Ranch House

In his talk, Randy encouraged parents to allow their children to paint on their bedroom
walls. “As a favor to me,” he said, “let ’em do it. Don’t worry about the home’s resale
value.” The real message he says he was trying to give was this: Find ways to help your
kids be creative. Nurture those instincts in them.
What would you paint on your bedroom walls if you were given permission to do so?
What other creative outlet would you like to pursue, if your parents gave the OK?

I Never Made It to the NFL

Randy believed our critics are often the ones saying they still care about us. How in your
own life has a critic helped you become a better person?

The Happiest Place on Earth

Randy said: “Brick walls are there for a reason. They’re not there to keep us out. The
brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something.” What
are the brick walls you’ve faced in your own life? How did you get over them?
